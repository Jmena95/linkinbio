<h1> Justin Menas Link in Bio </h1>
<p> Hello everyone, for my Link in Bio I wanted to add more than social media links and articles related to tech.</p>
<p> I wanted a represetation of me and what I like to do as hobbies, what I'm working on as an individual and a link to where I am currently working at. </p>
<p> I added My Ebay store link and an article showing people how to get started just in case they had some insterest in reselling items. </p>
<p> Fitness and working on being stronger mentally is something I try working on consistently and I always encourage others to do the same. </p>
<p> Linking my current employers webpage is just to show where I work and what I do for a living. </p>
<p> Thank you for looking at my page and finding out more about myself.</p>
